# CVEAllTheThings

A collection of CVE exploit scripts written in Python.

## FAQ

Q: Why?  
A: First of all, fun. 
   Secondly, I'm annoyed about needing to spend valuable time finding and potentially fixing old CVE POCs, so I just made my own repo.

Q: How can I contribute?  
A: Just make a pull request and I will review it, but be sure to first check out the sample script, to get a feeling of how a script should be structured.

## Additional Info
- Most scripts are written in python and have the same structure, but some CVEs require a different approach (e.g. if we need compiled C code, etc.)
- Inspired by the [trickest/cve](https://github.com/trickest/cve) repo :)
- Credit is always given in the README of the exploit and/or in the code
