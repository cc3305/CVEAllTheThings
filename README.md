# CVEAllTheThings

A collection of CVE exploit scripts written in Python.

## FAQ

Q: Why?  
A: First of all, fun. 
   Secondly, I'm annoyed about needing to spend valuable time finding and potentially fixing old CVE POCs, so I just made my own repo.

Q: How can I contribute?  
A: I have yet to figure that out (see issues)

Q: How do I use this?
A: You can either clone just the repo for the CVE you need or you can clone all of them like this: `git clone https://github.com/cc3305/CVEAllTheThings --recursive --shallow-submodules`

## Additional Info
- Most scripts are written in python and have the same structure, but some CVEs require a different approach (e.g. if the exploit needs compiled C code, etc.)
- Inspired by the [trickest/cve](https://github.com/trickest/cve) repo :)
- Credit is always given in the README of the exploit and/or in the code
